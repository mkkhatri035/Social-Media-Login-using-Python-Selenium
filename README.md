# Social-Media-Login-using-Python-Selenium

Usage modules: Selenium(https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/), Pysimplegui(https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Overview: uses selenium driver to open browser and pysimplegui to graphically view and take the input from the user.

Working: Opens the browser and takes username and password from user. Also user provides the social media platform where he/she wants to login from given ones and launches a GUI window asking user for input. After taking all the details from user takes user to specified social media platform and logs into it and user does not need to open browser for each platform and then input their login details so reduces user efforts.
